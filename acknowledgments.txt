I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) as a support tool to help clarify assignment requirements, debug errors in my Python code, and sanity-check intermediate results while implementing ridge regression and LinUCB.

Libraries used beyond standard Python:
- pandas: for loading, reshaping, and saving TSV files
- numpy: for matrix operations and linear algebra
- scikit-learn: for ridge regression (Part 3)

No other outside sources were used.
